# Global_wheat_detection

Detecting wheat heads from aerial satellite imagenery

## Two approaches 

* [**1st approach trained using Retina Net with help of fastai. For quick experimentation and beginners.**](https://github.com/shadab4150/Global_wheat_detection/blob/master/Project_Global_wheat_detection_.ipynb)
* [**2nd Pure pytorch, Trained using pytorch faster rcnn model. For more intermediate learners.**](https://github.com/shadab4150/Global_wheat_detection/blob/master/global-wheat-detection-pytorch-faster-rcnn.ipynb)
